      <h1>My Experience at Fasiculus</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>During my 2 weeks of internship at Fasiculus I had the opportunity to work with professionals in a variety of fields, including operations, sales, marketing, and more,
         which proved to be a tremendous learning experience for me in the professional space. Fasiculus is a company that specializes in digitalizing and optimizing products which
         can contribute to a more sustainable future. I was given the project RVM, short for reverse vending machines, as part of my internship. Reverse vending machines are devices
         that collect plastic products (only recyclable plastic products, such as plastic bottles) from customers and prepare them for recycling. My task was to conduct research make
         a report on factors that would enhance the functionality of the RVM. For instance, to assist the RVM in separating various forms of plastic, I analyzed the various types of
         plastic and their chemical composition to determine which types are recyclable and which types are hazardous to recycle. The options for recycling plastic cigarette butts were
         something else I researched about. Another task I was given was to come up with strategies to encourage people to recycle plastic bottles using RVM as many just throw them away.
         In addition to writing reports, I performed on-site observations to see if people were using RVM or merely throwing the plastic bottles away.</p>

         <p>What can individuals do to help create a sustainable world is a common question. This question is now answered thanks to RVM because it enables everyone to contribute to a sustainable future.
         The two most significant skills I learned during this internship were time management and teamwork. Naturally, I had my academics and other coursework in addition to my internship, but by creating time
         schedules and organising my work according to priorities, I learned how to effectively manage my time. Additionally, I improved my teamwork skills while working on the project
         with my team in order to efficiently and successfully finish the project.Overall, this project was quite fascinating since it showed how modern technology might enable us to
         build a more sustainable world.</p>
