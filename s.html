    <h1>My Experience at Safe City</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>During my winter vacation, I was exploring different programs and internships when I came across the Safe City volunteer program.
       The name of this program itself was quite interesting and it got me curious about this volunteering program. After applying for the program,
       I discovered that this program was administered by an organization called Red Dot Foundation. The Red Dot Foundation Group supports the safe
       city project with the help of technology, communications, data, and urban  planning. Safecity is a platform where people can anonymously report
       complaints about sexual harassment and abuse in public places. This information is integrated by Safe City via crowdsourcing and displayed as
       hotspots on a map that represent regional crime or violence. The idea is to make this data useful for individuals, local communities, and local
       administration to identify factors that causes behavior that leads to violence and work on strategies for solutions.

       <p>My responsibility in this
       program was to gather 20 reports of individuals who had encountered sexual harassment or other violations, and to enter the reports on the safe city website.
       I previously assumed the work to be simple, but as soon as I began collecting the report, I realized how challenging it was. For many reasons, including fear
       of society, awkwardness, culture, victim blaming etc., most people didn't want to discuss about the offenses they had faced. However, I explained them that
       this information was essential as it would help raise awareness about such harassments and inspire more people to speak out against them and this would also help
       authorities to identify factors that causes behavior that leads to violence and work on strategies for solutions. </p>

       <p>From this volunteering work I learned that by sharing
       one's experiences, one can inspire others to speak up for themselves and confront their perpetrator. Instead of filing a FIR or going straight to the
       police, people feel more comfortable with using a platform where their identity can remain anonymous. I also learned that how we can utilize methods to examine a variety
       of social problems with the help of data management like using crowdsourcing software and urban planning.</p>
